# **Brain Tumor Classification Using Deep Learning**

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project can be accessed from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset). It consists of MRI images of brain tumors categorized into classes for supervised learning.

## **Working Procedure**
This project focuses on a comparative analysis of five state-of-the-art deep learning models to classify brain tumors. The models evaluated are:

1. **VGG16**
2. **VGG19**
3. **GoogleNet**
4. **ResNet50**
5. **DenseNet121**

Each model's performance is evaluated based on key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
